# apa4ubu
This script installs Apache for Ubuntu, customizes bash shell text color, changes default password, configures the firewall, preps a new site- includes virtual host files and landing page creation, and creates a new user once work is complete in root.

This has not been thouroughly tested, nor have I attempted to run it, in quite some time. Update will be posted to readme when I've had the chance to do so. Feel free to review, test, contribute, and/or improve in any way. Cheers!
